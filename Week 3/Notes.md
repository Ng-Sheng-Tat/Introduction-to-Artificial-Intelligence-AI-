## Week 3
- concerns surrounding AI includes
  1. Privacy
  2. Ownership
  3. Bias: Machine Learning tends to bias towards input data to suit a desired output
- therefore, ethics in AI development is important
- the issues of avoid bias, use good and effective training data, perform regular test and audit must be given great attentions
- **AI powered risk assessment systems** used in courts that help predict the probability of a person re-offending, and hence provide guidelines for sentencing or granting parole, based on the calculated risk of recidivism. There is concern that these systems may be biased against people of color.
- **Trust** can be gained by four criterias
  1. Transparency: people are aware that they are interacting with AI, and understand what their expectations for the interaction should be
  2. Accountability: AI system are created with Algorithmic accountability so that any unexpected results can be traced and undone if required
  3. Privacy: protected personal information
  4. Lack of Bias: uses representative training data to avoid bias and regular audits to detect any bias creeping in
  - should maintained an informed and balanced view
  - rule-based, repreated and automable jobs will be replaced by AI and robotics, such as automobile, call center operatives, salesperson, bank tellers
  - however, AI creates new jobs that do not exist before as well and according to statistics it will be able to exceed the jobs replaced by AI, such as Robots Maintenance
  - hence, it is important to always learn new professional skills and up-skill and re-skill to secure future job opportunity

  Reading: AI Working for Good
In the BBC’s Machine Minds feature, Richard Gray writes about the many benefits of AI in today’s world. The article is summarized below, and you can read the whole article here: Treating cancer, stopping violence… How AI protects us.

There are many applications of AI that are beneficial to society, helping to protect us from disease, from crime, from hunger, and from ourselves.

In the health field, AI systems are making impacts in controlling the spread of infectious diseases like Dengue fever, yellow fever, and Zika, by predicting outbreaks. The Artificial Intelligence in Medical Epidemiology (Aime) system uses over 270 variables to predict the next Dengue fever outbreak, and has an 88% accuracy rate up to three months in advance. (Aime)

Early detection is crucial in the successful treatment of many cancers, sight loss, and other health problems. AI is having an impact here too. IBM Watson systems are being trained to identify tumors and help diagnose breast, lung, prostrate, and other cancers. (IBM)

Google DeepMind is working with the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK to train AI systems to interpret eye scans. (DeepMind, Vox, Forbes)

Violent crime is a seemingly insoluble issue, but again, AI is having an impact in two major areas: gun violence and knife crime. In the US, the Shotspotter system is being used to detect the sound of gunshots and alert authorities quickly. (Shotspotter)

In the UK, violent knife crime is a rapidly growing problem. Police Forces across the UK are exploring the use of an AI system called National Data Analytics Solution (NDAS). This system focuses on identifying people already known to the police who may be more likely to commit knife crime. The intention is to prioritize getting appropriate help and support for those people, but some people are interpreting this as predicting a crime before it happens, making the plan very contentious. (PublicTechnology.net)

In agriculture, keeping crops healthy and free from disease is a never-ending challenge. In areas at risk of famine, growers must be able to accurately identify multiple crop diseases with similar appearances and different treatments. In Uganda, the Mcrops project combines the use of photographs taken on cheap smartphones and computer vision to help farmers keep their crops healthy. (Mcrops)

Maximizing our efficient use of energy is critical to reducing the cost and impact of generating power. AI systems are being used here too, for managing increasingly complex electricity grids, locating damaged cables, and even helping to reduce the demand that devices make. (The conversation)

Reading: Principles for Ethical AI
At the World Economic Forum in 2017, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty spoke about the three guiding principles that IBM follows to ensure that the AI and cognitive systems it develops are ethical, trustworthy, and socially responsible.

Purpose
AI systems developed by IBM are designed to augment human intelligence, not to replace it. IBM refers to these systems as cognitive, rather than AI. Cognitive systems will not become conscious, or gain independent agency, but will always remain under the control of humans. Cognitive systems will be embedded in systems used to enhance human capabilities. Cognitive systems must be built with people in the industry.

"We say cognitive, not AI, because we are augmenting intelligence," Rometty said. "For most of our businesses and companies, it will not be man or machine... it will be a symbiotic relationship. Our purpose is to augment and really be in service of what humans do."

Transparency
Cognitive systems must be transparent to be fully accepted as a normal part of people’s everyday life. Transparency is required to gain public trust and confidence in AI judgments and decisions, so that cognitive systems can be used to their full potential.

For IBM, this has three parts:

People must be aware when they come into contact with AI and for what purposes it is used.

People must be aware of the major sources of data in use.

IBM clients always own their own business models, intellectual property, and data. Cognitive systems augment the client’s years of industry experience and domain specific knowledge.

IBM recognizes that AI systems must be built with people in the industry. "These systems will be most effective when trained with domain knowledge in an industry context," Rometty said.

Skills
There are two sides to the AI story; the cognitive systems, and the humans who use them. The human side of the story must also be supported.

IBM will work to help people gain the knowledge needed to engage with AI systems safely and securely. IBM will also help people develop the skills necessary to perform the new kinds of jobs that AI creates (much like this course you’re taking now).
