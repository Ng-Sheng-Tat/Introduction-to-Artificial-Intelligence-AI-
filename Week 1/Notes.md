## Week 1
- AI is defined as **Augmented Intelligence** which capables of extend the human capabilities
- AI analogous to every other creatures, learn from **examples** (from various data)
- the algorithm is based on human research
- types of learning includes: **Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning**
- involves field of electrical engineering, computer science, linguistic, philosophy, psychology, mathematics, statistics,
- AI can be classified into

| Weak/Narror AI | Strong/Generalized AI | Super/Conscious AI  |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| AI that is trained to do a particular task | Good in solving various problems, possessed the ability to self learn | AI with conscious, capable of thinking by their own |

- AI is a product of computational algorithms that does not developed by hard code but instead inherit from examples
- it finds underlying patterns within the examples that is not obvious to humans
- AI related occupations Video Game Designer, Screenwriter, Data Scientist
- AI Chatbots, text-to-speech, computer vision, fault detection
