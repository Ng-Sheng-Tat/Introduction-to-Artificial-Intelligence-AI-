## Week 2
- **Cognitive Computing** can derives meaningful information for humans based on data
- the four steps include
  1. Observations
  2. Interpret Hypothesis
  3. Evaluate Hypothesis
  4. Decision-making
- Cognitive computing systems differ from conventional computing systems in that they can:
  1. Read and interpret unstructured data, understanding not just the meaning of words but also the intent and context in which they are used.
  2. Reason about problems in a way that humans reason and make decisions.
  3. Learn over time from their interactions with humans and keep getting smarter.

**Terms often used in Artificial Intelligence**
1. Artificial Intelligence: a branch of computer science dealing with the simulation of intelligent behaviour
  - involves planning, learning, reasoning, problem-solving, knowledge, perception, motion, manipulation, social intelligence, creativity
2. Machine Learning: a subset of AI that uses computer algorithms to analyze data and make intelligent decisions based on what it has learned to find patterns, without being explicitly programmed
  - need training and learn from examples
  - it trains with large dataset as input together with answer, then it learns from the patterns and it will runs the rules defined by itself
  - relies on defining behavioral rules by examining and comparing large sets to find common patterns
  - **Supervised Learning** an algorithm trained based on human-labelled data, classification problems (Decision trees, SVM, logistics regressions, random forecast), regressions (finding relationships between variables in a graph), neural networks
  - features as the potential influencing factors
  - training refers to using a learning algorithm to determine and develop the parameters of your model
  - training set (train the algorithm), validation set (validate result and fine-tune the algorithm's parameters), testing set (never seen before and used to evaluate how good model is by using the terms accuracy, recall, precision)
  - **Unsupervised Learning** trained with unlabelled data and let it finds the underlying pattern by itself, they infer the qualities draw inferences, commonly used in Baseline, Normal network activity, outliers, malicious behaviour, clustering
  - **Reinforcement Learning** relies on providing a machine learning algorithm with a set of rules and constraints and letting it learn how to achieve it goals (GAME development)> It can be done by defining the state, the desired goal, allowed actions, and constraints. ultilized reward functions
3. Deep Learning: A specialized subset of Machine Learning that uses layered neural networks to simulate human decision-making, allows for continuously learning through (back-propagation) and improves the quality and accuracy of the results
- layers of algorithm that create a neural networks
- usually deals with unstructured large data
- understand the context and intent (NLP)
- input to deep layers of processings using to output
4. Neural Networks: Take inspiration from biological neural networks, although they work quite a bit differently
  - very efficient for dealing with BIG DATA
  - comprices of neurons
  - learn through a process called **back-propagation**, where a set of training adata that match known inputs to desired outputs.
  - first, inputs are feed into neural netwroks and output are determined, and then an error function is used to determin the outputs from the desired output, finally, adjustments are made to reduce the errors.
  - consists of input, deep neural network (hidden), output layers, and an activation function maps input into output, and determines how a node responds to its inputs
  - perceptrons as the simplest and oldest types of neural networks, as the single-layered neural networks consisting of input nodes connected directly to an output node.
  - Input layers forward the input values to the next layer, by means of multiplying by a weight and summing the results.
  - hidden and output nodes have **bias** as a special type of weight that applies to a node after the other inputs are considered.
**AI** and **Data Science** is not each other's subset, but they encompases each other in certain areas.
